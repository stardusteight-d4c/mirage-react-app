# Mirage Chat | Realtime Chat with Web Sockets

![banner](banner.png)

> Construction of a web chat with `bilateral communication` between server and client through `Web Sockets`, login and logout system and user sessions.
> In this application I used `Vercel` to upload the front-end and `Amazon Lightsail` to upload the back-end via `Cloud Computing` inside a `Docker` container
> hosted in a remote repository on `DockerHub`. To add dynamics to the front, the `Styled Components` library was used, which allows creating
> styles and pass styling props as React component props. There are also several checks performed on the form both on the server-side and on the
> client-side, all with visual feedback using `react-toastify`.
